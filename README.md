## Troubleshooting

### 🔧 Troubleshooting

#### API Connection Issues
- **"Invalid API Key" Error**: Double-check your API key for typos, make sure you're using a valid OpenRouter API key, try testing the connection in the popup settings
- **"Connection Failed" Error**: Check your internet connection, ensure OpenRouter.ai is accessible in your region, try again in a few moments (server might be temporarily unavailable)

#### Performance Issues
- **Slow Responses**: Try a different AI model (some are faster than others), reduce the max response length, check your internet connection, increase timeout settings for complex queries
- **High Memory Usage**: Use smaller models like Nova 2 Lite or Trinity Mini, reduce max tokens setting

#### Extension Issues
- **Extension Not Working**: Make sure the extension is enabled in Chrome, check that you have the latest version, try reloading the extension
- **Button Not Appearing**: Check that "Show Answer Button" is enabled in options, refresh the webpage
